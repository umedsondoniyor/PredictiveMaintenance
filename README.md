## Confirmation
After making plenty of researches I found more specific information on this website.Engine degradation simulation was carried out using C-MAPSS. Four different were sets simulated under different combinations of operational conditions and fault modes. Records several sensorchannels to characterize fault evolution. The data set was provided by the Prognostics CoE at NASA Ames.
