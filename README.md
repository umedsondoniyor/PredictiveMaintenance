# PredictiveMaintenance

## Confirmation
After making plenty of researches found info on this website.
 Engine degradation simulation was carried out using C-MAPSS. 
 Four different were sets simulated under different combinations 
 of operational conditions and fault modes. Records several sensor
  channels to characterize fault evolution. The data set was provided 
  by the Prognostics CoE at NASA Ames.
